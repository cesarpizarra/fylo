This repository contains my solution to the [Fylo dark theme landing page](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/fylo-dark-theme-landing-page-5ca5f2d21e82137ec91a50fd) challenge on Frontend Mentor. The challenge involved building a responsive landing page. I used the following technologies for this project:

- Vite: A fast and lightweight build tool that provides a seamless development experience.
